# Audio-Effect-Mixer
Building an Audio mixer on Simulink.
The study and implementation of different Audio effects on Simulink.Then using those subsystems to create a full mixing table with an interface that permits the user to change variables in each subsytem.
This Project can be used to add different raw musical instruments and output a well mixed track. Or it can be just used to add effects to a single input track.
